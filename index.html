    <p> This is the website of Xinke Guo-Xue </p>

    <p> I majored in math at MIT.</p>

    <p> I run math classes for a living.</p>

    <p> I plan to run one or two Intermediate Geometry classes for AIME preparation in late fall of 2020-2021 </p>

    <p> I am currently running two Intermediate Probability and Counting classes, along with a Mathcounts class and an AMC 10/12 class.

    <p> My group lesson rates are $50 for a 2 hour class, given the class has at least 3 students.

    <p> For more information, contact me at xinkeguoxue@gmail.com </p>
